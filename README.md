Project Name: Divisible Sum Pairs (HackerRank Solution)

Description:

This Java program finds the number of pairs in an array whose sum is divisible by a given divisor (k). It implements a solution to the "Divisible Sum Pairs" challenge on HackerRank.

Input:

The program expects two lines of input from the console:

The first line contains two space-separated integers:
n: The length of the input array.
k: The divisor to check for divisibility.
The second line contains space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.
Output:

The program outputs the number of pairs in the array where the sum of each pair is divisible by k.

Usage:

Save the code as a Java file (e.g., DivisibleSumPairs.java).

Compile the code using a Java compiler:

Bash
javac DivisibleSumPairs.java
Use code with caution.
Run the compiled program:

Bash
java DivisibleSumPairs
Use code with caution.
You will be prompted to enter the input on the console.

Example:

Input:

5 3
1 3 2 6 1
Output:

3
Explanation:

In this example, there are three pairs in the array [1, 3], [2, 6], and [3, 2] (considering order doesn't matter) where the sum is divisible by 3 (k).

Dependencies:

The code doesn't require any external libraries beyond those included in the standard Java installation.

Additional Notes:

The time complexity of the nested loop approach used in this code is O(n^2) in the worst case. For larger datasets, consider using a more efficient algorithm like a hash table-based approach that can achieve O(n) time complexity.
Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs, such as adding input validation or error handling.
